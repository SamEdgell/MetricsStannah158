Async Tasks:
1) TASK_MessageProcessing
    An asynchronous task running on the main event loop. Its job is to wait for and process messages from a queue, allowing it to update the UI without blocking.

Threads:
1) GUI
    When the application starts, a QApplication object is created. The thread that executes this code becomes the GUI thread.
    This is the main thread of the program. When the applications event loop is started (Which is managed by qasync, which integrates with QT's loop),
    that GUI thread is now dedicated to running the event loop. Its job is to process events like mouse clicks, button presses, signals,
    painting and updating widgets on the screen.

2) Port Handler
    Thread to periodically check for available ports.

3) Serial Handler
    Thread to receive/transmit data over the connected serial port using pyserial.

4) Plotting (Future)
    With a no-GIL Python 3.14 build, this thread will run CPU-intensive tasks like generating a plot.
    This will allow the task to run on a separate CPU core, achieving true parallelism without the overhead of a separate process.

Process:
1) Plotting (Current)
    A seperate process is created to run CPU-intensive tasks like generating a plot.
    This uses 'multiprocessing' to run the task on a different CPU core, preventing the main GUI thread from freezing.
